# Internet-of-Things-Intrusion-Detection-Algorithm-Based-on-Big-Data

In order to promote the large-scale application of the Internet of Things and reduce security risks in the home Internet of Things scenario, this paper studies the home Internet of Things network traffic, finds the correlation between traffic anomalies and traffic characteristics, and uses it to determine whether the traffic is abnormal and detect whether the device is invaded.

The codes refer to following aspects:
1. Feature selection. Feature selection is used to reduce the dimension of data, and select the most representative feature subset.
2. Supervised Learning. Use supervised learning to verify the validity of feature subset.
3. Unsupervised Learning. Because the traffic data in real world is not labeled abnormal or not, the unsupervised learning model should be selected as the model of the detection system. Compare different models (accuracy, F1 value and time cost) and select the most suitable one.
